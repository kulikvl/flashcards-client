## Overview

This is the front-end component of the Flashcards Application. It's developed using Java and Spring Boot as a multi-page application, employing server-side rendering (SSR) with the Thymeleaf engine to serve pages to the end user. The interface includes functionality for creating flashcards, assigning tags, studying them, and sorting based on selected tags. Additionally, users with admin roles have the capability to delete users.

## Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
